        We are collecting answers to the multiple choice questions to study machine understanding of English. Thank you for your help!
      </p>

      <p>You will be presented with a passage and three sets of a question and options. The set of options is identical for the three questions.</p>

      <p>1. <strong>Select the one answer choice</strong> given each question and a set of options.
        If you find the questions fall in the following conditions;

          <ul>
            <li>Multiple choices are likely.</li>
            <li>No options are likely.</li>
            <li>Question is difficult to understand, comprehend, or answer. (Please rewrite the question in the box if possible)</li>
          </ul>

        choose the corresponding option among the three options indicating each condition. When nothing above represents the reason well, but you still find some problems in the presented questions, please indicate using the text box.
      </p>

      <p>2. <strong>Content Filtering:</strong> If you notice any offensive words, negative stereotypes, or harmful social implications about social groups (such as people of color, women, immigrants, religions) in the presented passage, assumption, and story endings,
        please write them down in the textbox. You may also use this box to indicate any typos or grammatical errors. After we check if it is relevant, you will receive a bonus of $0.3. There is no right answer to this, and as long as you don't write something completely irrelevant, you don't need to worry about if they are valid enough.
      </p>

        We recommend spending 3-5 minutes on each HIT.
