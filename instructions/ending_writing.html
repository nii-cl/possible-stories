      Guidelines for the Task
    </span>
    <p>
      The goal here is to modify stories to make them those <i>you</i> think are unique, less stereotypical, less usual,
      but those other people will still be able to enjoy it as a story.
      <br>
      Here are some guidelines:
      <ul>
        <li>You are encouraged to be <strong>as creative as possible</strong>, such as;
          <ul>
            <li>
              imagining yourself as a different person and describing how that person would behave in the given condition.
            </li>
            <li>
              introducing extraterrestrial beings, animals that can communicate with humans.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Consider modifying the stories while paying attention to:
        <ul>
          <li>Characters' feelings and motivations</li>
          <li>Causes and consequences of described events</li>
          <li>Definition, properties, and process explained in a passage</li>
          <li>Summary and lesson of a passage</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
          Use words and phrases that donâ€™t appear in the passage as many as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write an ending <strong>in ONE sentence.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Write story endings that are <strong>quite different</strong> from the original story endings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, the two story endings you wrote must be <strong>quite different</strong> from each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before submission, make sure you read the whole passage with the ending you write so that you can confirm that the story is possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
