      We are collecting questions to study machine understanding of English. Thank you for your help! We appreciate your amazing jobs so far!
    </p>

    <p>
      In this task, you will be given a passage and four options that have been collcected as endings before and then selected automatically. </br>
      Your task is to <strong>write two challenging questions with a single correct answer for each, given the short passage and the four answer options. </strong>
      Accordingly, you need to <strong>check the correct answer option for the questions you write</strong> by checking the option, and the correct options to the two questions should be different from each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      In writing the questions,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        [Important!] You must ensure that the answer to the question is <strong>a single option among the four options presented</strong>, and you <strong>cannot modify the options.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        The questions you write must be answerable based on the text in the passage and question, combined with some reasonings.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should assume that the reader has general background knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should also assume that the reader can speculate about something that is not explicitly stated in the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        It should not be easy to eliminate or guess the answer choice/s without reading the passage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Likewise, it should also not be easy to eliminate answer choice/s <i>without reading the question</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, there is no problem in writing two similar questions (with minimal editions) as long as they have different options as their answers!
      </li>
    </ul>

      Guidelines for Writing Questions
    </span>

    <p>
      Here are some guidelines for writing questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consider questions that ask about:
        <ul>
          <li>Characters' feelings and motivations (sad, happy etc consequence for the protagonists)</li>
          <li>Causes and consequences of described events (both before and after the option occcurs)</li>
          <li>Definition, properties, and process explained in a passage (additional premises)</li>
          <li>Summary and lesson of a passage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider the following writing styles:
        <ul>
          <li>Use words and phrases that don't appear in the passage and the answer options</li>
          <li>Use abstract words</li>
          <li>Make construction of the sentence complex with negation or insertion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Write questions that are answerable based only on the text in the passage and the question.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="context-text">
      <p>
        In the morning I got out of bed a little late. 
        To make up for lost time I did not make a lunch. 
        By the time I left the house I was only 2 minutes late. 
        The traffic was light so I made it to work on time.

      Good Example 1
    </span>
    <p>
      <u>Question:</u> Which one of the following is most likly to happen after this, if I usually eat something before starting work?
    </p>
    <span><u>Answer options:</u></span>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>
        (a) I began waking up late often. (<strong>correct</strong>)
      </li>
      <li>
        (b) I had enough time to get a cup of coffee in the breakroom before starting work.
      </li>
      <li>
        (c) When I got to work I realized it was Saturday and I didn't need to be there.
      </li>
      <li>
        (d) I was even able to grab breakfast on the way to the office.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>
        Explanation: the question has only one right answer. 
        Using "after this" requires reading the passage. 
        (When there are similar options, it happens that the possible question is such that one can assume the right answer without reading the passage. 
        In that case, do your best to use paraphrasing to make it less easy. e.g. drink a cup of coffee --> need caffeine)
